# Fraction
We know that there is no method to return a number as fraction in python.
If we use '/' it will give us the float value for division.
Hence, I have tried to make my own "Fraction" class, including all the operations that can be performed on any fraction. Quite similarly as done in Mathematics.

This method typically contains the following opearstions on fractions-
a) addition
b)subtraction
c)multiplication
d)divison
e)equality operations such as-
   a)less than
   b)greater tha
   c)less than equal to
   d)greater than equal to
   e)equal to
   f)not equal to

This a full-fledged fraction class. Here one can perform any operations as one can do on fractions in mathematics. It will always returns approopiate values in the form of fractions, and fractions.
